**Angry Aliens** is an open source game made with Godot Engine 3.2.1.

Source code is MIT licensed. Feel free to read it, modify it and reuse it in your projects.

Gameplay is definitely inspired by *Angry Birds*.

## Branches: `master`, `develop` and `video`
- `develop` branch contains the complete project.Some advanced features may not be included in the master branch.
- `master` branch will be in sync with video tutorials releases on my YouTube channel.
- `videoX/start` branches contains the code to follow the tutorial number `X`. Example:
  - `video5/start` contains the code to follow the [video tutorial 5](https://youtu.be/SVuOYKzTwxw) on YouTube.

## Prerequisites

The tutorials require basic Godot understanding about Scenes, GDScript, 2D Nodes such as Sprite2D, CollisionShape2D, Area2D.

You can learn these topics by:

- reading the [official documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/step_by_step/intro_to_the_editor_interface.html)
- following my [video tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY1zuH2mHQ0&list=PLaCq3HqKQR6rlPpf2GAOXp52ddt0V71Yl) on Godot 3 basics (*only in Italian*)

## Tutorial Contents

### 1. Introduction

- üé• [YouTube - #1 - Introduzione](https://youtu.be/x0emyyXC_sM)

This tutorial series will focus on creating a simple mobile game
using Godot 3.2.

I choose to make an Angry Birds clone because:

1. it is short to recreate (without adding polish) 
2. it allows to stress Godot performances on the worst case scenario: intense game (physics based) on a low-power device (smartphone)

I'm creating these tutorials using Manjaro Linux (Arch Linux derivative), but similar steps can be done on other operating systems as well.

Currently I don't have an Apple device and I cannot develop/test iOS/OSX games. I'll try to provide instructions for other OSs, but help here is really appreciated (especially if you are a Debian, Ubuntu, Windows or OSX user).

### 2. Configure Godot and Android SDK

- üé• [YouTube - #2 - Configurare Linux](https://youtu.be/xFia7zG8NGA)
- üé• [YouTube - #3 - Configurare Windows](https://youtu.be/PNj8YmXjj-A)
  
> How do I configure my computer for Android development?

- `android-tools` and `jdk-openjdk`
- debug keystore
- Godot configuration
- Export templates
- **APK creation**
- APK one click installation

### 3. Testing performances on the smartphone

- üé• [YouTube - #4 - Creare il livello](https://youtu.be/VZS0pv14--s)
- üé• [YouTube - #5 - Creare la scena StressTest (pt1)](https://youtu.be/SVuOYKzTwxw)
- üé• [YouTube - #6 - Stress test (pt.2) - Debugger e profiler](https://youtu.be/s4jSWPtqR8M)
- üé• [YouTube - #7 - Stress test (pt.3) - Debugging su Android con Remote Debugger](https://youtu.be/-z6w9ArPFBY)

> If we include all the physics elements and we create hundreds of game objects, is the game playable?

### 4. Slingshot

- üé• [YouTube - #8 - Lancio Proiettili (Pt.1) - Godot 3.2 Tutorial](https://youtu.be/W16SLhgp8Zk)

### [EXTRA] Possible improvements / future topics

This tutorial covers only a small subset of mobile game development topics.

There are a lot of areas that can be explored, like:

- Publishing on a game store
  - Fdroid
  - Play Store
- Add audio sfx
- Improve the slingshot
  - elastic animation
- Parallax background
- Moving clouds
- Add particle effects
  - debris on obstacles destruction
  - dust effects on collisions
  - improve performances with object pooling
- Android modules
- Double tap, drag 'n drop, pinch to zoom,...
- Using Sensors (GPS, accelerometer, light sensor, bluetooth,...)

Some of these topics may be covered on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/CrystalBit)
as separated videos.

Keep an eye on the [Crystal Bit Github organization](https://github.com/crystal-bit) as well, because
all the source code for my tutorials will be uploaded here.
